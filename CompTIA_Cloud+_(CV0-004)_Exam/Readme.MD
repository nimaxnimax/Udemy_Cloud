Question 1
Which of the following is a benefit of using a Type 1 hypervisor instead of a Type 2 hypervisor?

A. Improved hardware compatibility  
B. Better application performance  
C. Increased management flexibility  
D. Enhanced user interface

Answer: B. Better application performance

Explanation:  
Type 1 hypervisors, also known as bare-metal hypervisors, run directly on the host's hardware, providing better performance because there is no underlying operating system. Type 2 hypervisors run on top of an existing operating system, adding additional overhead and potentially reducing performance.

Question 2
An administrator needs to set up a new VM in a public cloud. Which of the following would be the most appropriate method for doing so?

A. Using the provider's web portal  
B. Using a secure FTP connection  
C. Using a direct console connection  
D. Using an SSH connection to the hypervisor

Answer: A. Using the provider's web portal

Explanation:  
Most public cloud providers offer a web-based portal that allows administrators to easily create and manage virtual machines. This method is user-friendly and integrates various tools and options for VM configuration.

Question 3
Which of the following storage types provides the highest performance in a cloud environment?

A. Network Attached Storage (NAS)  
B. Object Storage  
C. Solid-State Drive (SSD)  
D. Magnetic Tape

Answer: C. Solid-State Drive (SSD)

Explanation:  
SSDs provide significantly faster data access speeds compared to traditional spinning hard drives or magnetic tape. They are the preferred choice for high-performance storage in cloud environments due to their low latency and high throughput.

Question 4
An organization needs to ensure its data is available in case of a site failure. Which of the following would be the best strategy?

A. Backup to magnetic tape  
B. Multi-site replication  
C. Snapshots  
D. Local backups

Answer: B. Multi-site replication

Explanation:  
Multi-site replication involves copying data to multiple geographic locations. This ensures data availability even if one site experiences a failure, providing robust disaster recovery and business continuity.

Question 5
Which of the following protocols is commonly used to secure communications between a client and a cloud service?

A. FTP  
B. HTTP  
C. LDAP  
D. TLS

Answer: D. TLS

Explanation:  
TLS (Transport Layer Security) is widely used to secure communications over a network. It encrypts data transmitted between a client and a cloud service, protecting it from eavesdropping and tampering.

Question 6
A cloud administrator is configuring the network for multiple VMs to communicate with each other. Which of the following virtual network components should the administrator configure?

A. VLAN  
B. VPN  
C. NAT  
D. Firewall

Answer: A. VLAN

Explanation:  
A VLAN (Virtual Local Area Network) allows a cloud administrator to segment a network logically, ensuring that multiple VMs can communicate securely and efficiently within the same virtual network infrastructure.

Question 7
In a cloud computing environment, what does the term "elasticity" refer to?

A. The ability to automatically scale resources up and down based on demand  
B. The ability to recover from failures automatically  
C. The ability to migrate workloads between different cloud providers  
D. The ability to provide consistent performance across different environments

Answer: A. The ability to automatically scale resources up and down based on demand

Explanation:  
Elasticity in cloud computing refers to the capability of dynamically adjusting computing resources (such as CPU, memory, and storage) to match the current demand. This allows for efficient resource utilization and cost management.

Question 8
What is the primary purpose of a cloud orchestration tool?

A. To automate the provisioning of cloud resources  
B. To monitor cloud resource usage  
C. To secure cloud environments  
D. To provide a user-friendly interface for cloud management

Answer: A. To automate the provisioning of cloud resources

Explanation:  
Cloud orchestration tools are designed to automate the provisioning, deployment, and management of cloud resources. They help streamline operations and ensure that resources are used efficiently and effectively.

Question 9
Which of the following cloud service models provides the highest level of control over the underlying infrastructure?

A. SaaS (Software as a Service)  
B. PaaS (Platform as a Service)  
C. IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service)  
D. DaaS (Desktop as a Service)

Answer: C. IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service)

Explanation:  
IaaS provides the highest level of control over the underlying infrastructure, allowing users to manage virtual machines, storage, networks, and other fundamental computing resources. SaaS and PaaS provide less control as they abstract more of the underlying infrastructure.

Question 10
Which of the following best describes a hybrid cloud?

A. A cloud model that combines private and public cloud resources  
B. A cloud model that uses a combination of SaaS and PaaS services  
C. A cloud model that is shared among multiple organizations  
D. A cloud model that is dedicated to a single organization

Answer: A. A cloud model that combines private and public cloud resources

Explanation:  
A hybrid cloud integrates private cloud (on-premises or dedicated) and public cloud resources, allowing data and applications to be shared between them. This model provides greater flexibility, scalability, and cost-efficiency.
